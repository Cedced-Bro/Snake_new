# Snake_new
This will be an advanced Snake Game.
The main game rules are very similar to the original Snake-Game, but instead of just growing, this game will also have some interesting levels which will make it hard to master.
Each level contains special tricks which will be introduced to the game, such as making the game faster, adding different items which help to survive or kill you.
In the last level there will be an errupting vulcano. To win the game you need to get a special amount of points.
To make this game more interesting to more people this game will have a German, English and Spanish translation when finished.

The game also comes with special tools and an Installer. These packages will also appear as a seperate API to be used in more projects.

As this will be part of a project in school this will be completed till end of october.
